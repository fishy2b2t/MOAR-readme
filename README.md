# MOAR : Minecraft Orchestrated Automation & Response

[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/evilinc-labs/MOAR/total.svg

A client-side Fabric mod that automates schematic building, spawn-proofing, and container management. Load a `.litematic`, point it at some supply chests, and let it build, restock, recover from disconnects, and keep working across long multi-container runs.

## 2.1 Highlights

- **Smarter printer detection** : auto-detects active Litematica placements and can fall back to hologram block correlation when the live placement list is unavailable
- **Resume-first building** : printer checkpoints survive disconnects and `/printer resume` restores the build state from disk
- **Safer mode switching** : toggling between manual printer mode and AutoBuild now resets stale pathing and in-flight placement state cleanly
- **Better no-Baritone fallback** : the built-in vanilla walker now respects nearby-goal radius better and avoids trying to path to unreachable vertical targets
- **Anti-cheat-aware placement pacing** : placement and shulker interaction flows now wait for calmer movement windows instead of blindly stacking packets into setbacks
- **Safer stash retrieval** : `/stash get` and `/stash kit load` skip protected supply/dump/storage containers, track owned shulkers, split oversized stacks, and abort cleanly after repeated failures

## What It Does

### Schematic Printer
Load a Litematica schematic and build it automatically  or toggle manual mode to place blocks yourself.

- **AutoBuild**: walks to each zone, grabs materials from supply chests, places blocks, and moves on
- **Manual + AutoBuild modes**: switch between assisted manual placement and full automation without stale walking/pathing state leaking across modes
- **Litematica auto-detection**: loads the closest active placement automatically and can re-anchor from hologram blocks when placement metadata is missing
- **Supply restocking**: indexes chests and shulker boxes; walks back to resupply when inventory runs low
- **Shulker handling**: places, opens, loots, and breaks shulkers from supply; cleans up temp platforms
- **Scaffold cleanup**: removes bridges and pillars placed during pathfinding after the build
- **Self-correction**: detects wrong blocks and replaces them
- **Placement verification**: waits for server confirmation to catch anti-cheat rollbacks and repeated rejected placements
- **Inventory-swap settling**: avoids firing placement packets immediately after hotbar swaps from the main inventory
- **Smart tool selection**: picks the fastest tool for breaking
- **Directional blocks**: handles stairs, slabs, trapdoors, doors, logs, pillars, etc.
- **Liquid pass**: places water/lava after solids to keep pathfinding intact
- **Checkpoints**: saves progress to SQLite; resume after disconnect with `/printer resume`
- **Area clearing**: mines out a region before building; dumps items into designated chests
- **Protected pathfinding**: Baritone routes around storage and interactive blocks instead of mining through them during automation-sensitive walks
- **Pathfinding** : uses [Baritone](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone) if installed, otherwise falls back to a built-in vanilla walker tuned for nearby-zone approaches

### SpawnProofer
Define a region and let it place light sources on every dark spawnable surface.

- **Greedy solver** : picks positions that cover the most dark spots per placement
- **Embed mode** : swaps ground blocks for full-block lights (glowstone, sea lanterns, froglights)
- **Supply chests** : restocks light sources automatically
- **Pause/resume** : pause a run mid-route and continue later without redefining the region

### Stash Manager
Scan, index, and organize containers across large areas.

- **Container indexing** : scans chests, barrels, shulker boxes, and hoppers in a defined region
- **Experimental auto-organizing** : sorts items into columns, packs shulkers, handles overflow
- **Item retrieval** : `/stash get <item> [count]` walks the stash and pulls exact items back to the player
- **Kit system** : save, snapshot, edit, list, and load named loadouts with `/stash kit ...`
- **Region profiles** : save/load/delete named scan regions with `/stash region ...`
- **Protected-container blacklist** : stash retrieval skips printer supply chests, dump chests, and storage-designated containers
- **Smarter shulker retrieval** : tracks owned shulkers, re-deposits no-longer-needed ones, and splits oversized stacks instead of over-pulling
- **Waypoint walking** : navigates between zones for areas beyond render distance
- **CSV export** : exports the full inventory index to file
- **Dump chests** : designate chests for depositing mined items during area clearing
- **REST API** : embedded HTTP server with Prometheus metrics for Grafana dashboards
- **Webhook** : POST JSON to n8n or other services on scan completion

### API & Monitoring

MOAR includes an embedded HTTP API for Grafana dashboards, Prometheus scraping, and n8n webhook integrations. All settings live in `config/moar/moar.properties` (auto-created on first launch).

#### Configuration (`config/moar/moar.properties`)

```properties
# Enable the embedded API server
api.enabled=false
# Bind address (use 0.0.0.0 to expose externally)
api.bind=127.0.0.1
# HTTP port
api.port=8585
# Bearer token for auth (leave blank to disable auth)
api.key=
# POST JSON to this URL on scan completion (n8n, etc.)
webhook.url=
```

#### REST Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/v1/status` | GET | Scanner state, index size, region info |
| `/api/v1/containers?page=1&size=50` | GET | Paginated container list |
| `/api/v1/search?item=diamond` | GET | Find containers holding an item |
| `/api/v1/stats` | GET | Aggregate statistics (JSON) |
| `/api/v1/metrics` | GET | Prometheus-format metrics |
| `/api/v1/organizer` | GET | Organizer state and progress |
| `/api/v1/webhook/test` | POST | Webhook connectivity test |

All endpoints accept `Authorization: Bearer <api.key>` when `api.key` is set.

#### Grafana Setup

See [docs/grafana-setup.md](docs/grafana-setup.md) for a step-by-step guide to connect Prometheus + Grafana dashboards via Docker Compose.

### Keybinds

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Numpad 0` | Toggle printer on/off |

## Building from Source

Requires **JDK 21+**.

```bash
./gradlew build                  # Build all versions
./gradlew :1.21.8:build          # Build one version
./gradlew buildAndCollect        # Collect all JARs → build/libs/2.1.0/
```

Output: `versions/<mc>/build/libs/moar-2.1.0+<mc>.jar`

### Build Stack

| Tool | Version |
|------|---------|
| [Stonecutter](https://stonecutter.kikugie.dev/) | 0.8.3 |
| [Fabric Loom](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loom) | 1.16.1 |
| [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) | 9.4.0 |

### Baritone Integration

Baritone is loaded via reflection at runtime : no compile dependency, nothing bundled. If Baritone isn't installed, the mod uses its built-in vanilla walker instead. On Baritone-enabled installs, MOAR also protects storage and other interactive blocks from path-mining during sensitive automation flows.
