**MOAR** — *Minecraft Orchestrated Automation & Response* — is a free, open-source client-side Fabric mod focused on advanced automation: schematic building, nether highway travel, spawn-proofing, and container management with minimal micromanagement. Load a `.litematic`, point it at some supply chests, and let it build, restock, recover from disconnects, and keep working across long multi-container runs.

## Features

### Automation Engine
* **Schematic Printer:** Full integration with **Litematica** and schematic files for seamless automated building — auto-detects active placements, with hologram block correlation as a fallback when the live placement list is unavailable.
* **AutoBuild:** Walks to each build zone, grabs materials from supply chests, places blocks, and moves on — including shulker handling, scaffold cleanup, and self-correction of wrong blocks.
* **Block State Handling:** Natively supports directional blocks including stairs, slabs, trapdoors, doors, logs, and pillars, plus a dedicated liquid pass that places water/lava after solids to keep pathfinding intact.
* **Multi-Schematic Queue:** Detect and queue all Litematica placements, then build them sequentially with auto-advance, manual reordering, and completion notifications.
* **Resume-First Building:** Printer checkpoints are saved to SQLite and survive disconnects — `/printer resume` restores the build state from disk.

### Highway Travel
* **End-to-End Nether Runs:** Plans multi-leg routes (approach → bounce → off-ramp → free flight) from your current position to any destination — fully hands-off.
* **Bounce Engine:** Elytra bounce flight with geometric ground/air detection, smooth re-launch, diagonal highway support, and lateral knockback recovery.
* **Grief Detour:** Detects griefed sections mid-bounce, plans a Baritone ground bypass, then resumes bouncing past the damage — up to 10 consecutive retries.
* **Elytra Resupply:** Monitors durability mid-travel and runs a full resupply cycle (shulker pull → equip → Mend via XP bottles → swap all inventory elytras) without interrupting the mission.

### Stash Management
* **Container Indexing:** Scans chests, barrels, shulker boxes, and hoppers across large areas — with waypoint walking for regions beyond render distance.
* **Item Retrieval:** `/stash get <item> [count]` walks the stash and pulls exact items back to you, skipping protected supply/dump/storage containers.
* **Kit System:** Save, snapshot, edit, and load named loadouts with `/stash kit ...`.
* **Storage Lanes:** Assign items to dedicated chest lanes and auto-sort your inventory into them — with a preview-first workflow so nothing moves until you confirm it.

### Stability & Safety
* **Anticheat Ready:** Built with **Grim** and other modern anticheats in mind — placement pacing waits for calmer movement windows instead of blindly stacking packets into setbacks.
* **Placement Verification:** Waits for server confirmation to catch anti-cheat rollbacks and repeated rejected placements.
* **Protected Pathfinding:** Baritone routes around storage and interactive blocks instead of mining through them during automation-sensitive walks.
* **Type-Safe Commands:** Uses Minecraft's statically typed command system to ensure input accuracy and reliability.

### Specialized Tools
* **SpawnProofer:** Define a region and let a greedy solver place light sources on every dark spawnable surface — including embed mode for full-block lights like glowstone and froglights.
* **In-Game GUI:** `/moar gui` opens a control screen with tabs for Kits, Index, Regions, Retrieve, Printer, Spawnproof, and API settings.
* **REST API & Monitoring:** Embedded HTTP server with Prometheus metrics for Grafana dashboards and webhook integrations (n8n and friends).

## Getting Started

How do I...

<details>
<summary><strong>... open the GUI?</strong></summary>

> Run `/moar gui` — it has tabs for Kits, Index, Regions, Retrieve, Printer, Spawnproof, and API settings.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>... build a schematic?</strong></summary>

> 1. Place or load a schematic in Litematica, then run `/printer detect` or `/printer load mybase.litematic`
> 2. If you loaded manually, stand where the build origin should be and run `/printer here`
> 3. Mark your supply chests with `/printer supply add` while looking at each container
> 4. Use `/printer autobuild` for full automation, then `/printer toggle` to start
> 5. If you disconnect mid-build, return and use `/printer resume`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>... build multiple schematics in a row?</strong></summary>

> 1. Place multiple schematic placements in Litematica
> 2. Run `/printer queue detect` to auto-detect and queue all placements
> 3. Mark your supply chests with `/printer supply add`
> 4. Use `/printer autobuild`, then `/printer toggle` — each schematic completes and auto-advances to the next
> 5. Check progress with `/printer queue status`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>... travel the nether highways?</strong></summary>

> Run `/moar travel goto <x> <z>` for nether coordinates, or `/moar travel goto <x> <z> overworld` to auto-divide overworld coordinates by 8. MOAR plans the route, bounces down the highway, detours around grief, and resupplies elytras on the way.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>... spawn-proof an area?</strong></summary>

> Set corners with `/spawnproof pos1` and `/spawnproof pos2`, mark a light supply chest with `/spawnproof supply add`, then run `/spawnproof start`.

</details>

## Developing

### Building from Source

Requires **JDK 21+** for 1.21.x builds. The experimental 26.1.1 target requires **JDK 25+** and is only included when explicitly requested.

```bash
./gradlew build                  # Build targets supported by the current JDK
./gradlew :1.21.8:build          # Build one version
./gradlew -Pmoar.includeJava25Targets=true build  # Include 26.1.1 on JDK 25+
./gradlew buildAndCollect        # Collect all JARs -> build/libs/<mod.version>/
```
